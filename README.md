# XMTP+LIT+ChromeExt+ChatOnWeb3WithTokenGatingContent

XMTP web3 chat improvement that with chrome notification, token gating and NFT unlocking widget in chat box ;)

We build a chrome extension that can notify users that they have new messages coming from XMTP.
And we inject into the XMTP Chat Opensource code with LIT and IPFS(via NFT.Storage) that provide users a token gating chat UX.
Users can send images with title/description and NFT gating contract addresses that only users with the NFT in their wallet can `unlock` the image.
This can be used as `chat 2 earn` or `selling while chatting`
